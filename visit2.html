With an average rainfall of 120 inches a year, El Yunque has a very diverse ecosystem and is the home for hundreds of different and unique plants and animals,
including the famous <i>coqui</i> frog. The name of El Yunque is a reference to <i>Yuke</i>, which is what the indigenous Taino people define as "white lands".</p>
